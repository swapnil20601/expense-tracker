# STAR WARS API APP

<br>

_We all spend money on one or the other things on daily basis and hence we need need some way to keep track of the expenses that we are spending on. The **Expense-Tracker** app helps you to keep track of your daily expenses so that you can plan our finances and savings accordingly.
The idea of this application was to continue learning HTML/CSS & Javascript but to add in a JS Framework **React.js** as well since it makes your life easier creating UI.
With **Expense-Tracker** you can add an expense, delete an expense, update an existing expense.
Most importantly, you can also see all your previous expenses in an expense table even after you reload your page or re-open your browser because we are saving all our expenses in ***Local Storage*** . So you never miss them_.

## Prerequisites

You will need to install latest version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) depending upon the platform that you will be running this app on.
Any Editor of your choice. I used **Visual Studio Code** since it is easy to use and comes with bunch of plugins. You can download one if you wish by visiting [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/), again depending on the platform that you are using.
